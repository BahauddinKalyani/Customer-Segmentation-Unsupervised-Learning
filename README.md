# Customer-Segmentation-Unsupervised-Learning

This repository presents a customer segmentation analysis using the K-Means clustering algorithm. By grouping customers based on purchasing behavior, we gain valuable insights into their preferences and needs. The analysis involves evaluating five key performance indicators (KPIs) for the entire dataset and for each customer segment.

## Notebook Description

The Jupyter Notebook in this repository provides a comprehensive exploration of customer segmentation using K-Means clustering. The analysis covers the following aspects:

- Application of K-Means clustering for customer segmentation.
- Examination of five KPIs for the entire dataset.
- In-depth analysis of the same five KPIs for each customer segment.

## Contents

- [Notebook](Customer%20Segmentation.ipynb): Jupyter Notebook containing the analysis.
- [Data](processed.csv): Sample dataset used for the analysis.
